            <h3> Artist Statement</h3>
            <p> Complexity. You can find it everywhere, if you're keeping an eye out for it. Complexity in the world around me inspires my creativity. I easily get lost in the infinite details and diversity of people, animals, and nature. Everyone has their own unique story to tell, and depending on who's telling it, the story can transform into a multitude of perspectives.</p>
            <br>
            <p> Visual storytelling is my passion. Or maybe obsession. If I'm recounting an episode from class to a friend, I'm the kind of person that will incorporate the pile of clementines on the table as "characters" in the story. I learned during my study abroad that this is the scientific process of "doll scenarios" that they often use for participatory design research.</p>
            <br>
            <p> Stories have the ability to both create escapist experiences as well as present a new understanding of the world around us. They are both a means of expression and a device to enlighten the audience. I love diving into the messy duality of things, exploring the difference and entanglement of "good" and "bad" within characters and story. Much of my work is almost a meditation of sorts, a reflection of my experiences onto alternative or fantastical worlds. I'm a perfectionist who's intrigued by the imperfection and messiness of life.</p>
            <br>
            <p> I'm an aspiring Storyboard Artist with experience in media, communications, and programming. I coded this portfolio website to highlight my skillsets as well as to create a user friendly navigation experience.</p>

            <h3> Quotations and Inspiration </h3>
            <p>"Character animation isn't the fact that an object looks like a character or has a face and hands. Character animation is when an object moves like it is alive, when it moves like it is thinking and all of its movements are generated by its own though processes... It is the thinking that gives the illusions of life. It is the life that gives meaning to the expression." - John Lasseter</p> 
            <br>
            <p>"You must see with eyes unclouded by hate. See the good in that which is evil, and the evil in that which is good. Pledge yourself to neither side, but vow instead to preserve the balance that exists between the two." <br>
            "I do believe in the power of story. I believe that stories have an important role to play in the formation of human beings, that they can stimulate, amaze and inspire their listeners." - Hayao Miyazaki</p>
            <br>
            <p>"It is hard to make that boat go as fast as you want it to. The enemy, of course, is resistance of the water, as you have to displace the amount of water equal to the weight of men and equipment, but that very water is what supports you and that very enemy is your friend. So is life: the very problems you must overcome also support you and make you stronger in overcoming them." - George Yeomen Pocock</p>
