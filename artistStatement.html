            <h3> Artist Statement</h3>
            <p> Complexity. You can find it everywhere, if you're keeping an eye out for it. Complexity in the world around me inspires my creativity. I easily get lost in the infinite details of uniqueness and diversity of people, animals, and nature. Everyone has their own unique story to tell, and depending on who's telling it, the story can transform into a multitude.</p>
            <br>
            <p> Visual storytelling is my passion. Or maybe obsession. If I'm recounting an episode from class to a friend, I'm the kind of person that will incorporate the pile of clementines on the table as "characters" in the story. I learned during my study abroad that this is actually the scientific process of "doll scenarios" that they often use for research. So I'm a grown adult, right?</p>
            <br>
            <p> Stories are as much as a means to experience and learn as they are a form of expression. Much of my work is almost a meditation of sorts, a reflection of my experiences onto alternative or fantastical worlds. I enjoy exploring both the "good" and the "bad" within people and characters, because, let's be honest, no one's "perfectly" good. And no one is above making a mistake or two. But the same can be said of "bad" guy characters, no one is 100% bad, as far as I can tell. It's the complexity of things that make them fun to explore. </p>
