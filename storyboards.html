(The movement from the beginning to the end of these shots has been towards the left). There is negative space in the left third of the frame, the direction their driving towards, giving them space to “move.” Eiji and Shorter’s silhouettes are seen in the truck, however Ash is nowhere to be seen, leaving to wonder where he is in the truck, if he is in the truck. The truck is now driving past the metal structure which was associated with Ash from earlier, beginning to leave it behind.">

Dino is slightly off center, and lower than the body guards, making him appear both more important and protected as he is framed by the other two characters. But this framing also implies entrapment. The bodyguards facial expressions are angry and tight, which is reflected by their structured and dark clothing.">

The light is coming from the top left of the frame, which casts shadows over the building and the truck.">

Ash’s facial expression is  very visible and it can be seen as now much more emotional and intense as his arms are still lifting the gun. Ash is also wearing relatively dark clothes.">
